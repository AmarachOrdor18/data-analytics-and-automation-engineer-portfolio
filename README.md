# Hi, I'm Amarachi 👋

## Building Systems That Make Work More Human

I'm a **Data Analytics & Automation Engineer** who believes that the best technology doesn't just process data—it removes the manual struggle from workflows and turns them into reliable, self-updating processes that free people to do what they do best.

## 🎯 What I Do

I bridge the gap between **data analysis** and **workflow design**. While many analysts stop at insights, I go further—I build systems that act on those insights automatically.

### My Sweet Spot
- **Data Analytics**: Uncovering patterns in messy data and translating them into actionable intelligence
- **Automation Engineering**: Designing workflows that eliminate repetitive tasks and reduce processing time by up to 90%
- **Real-Time Data Systems**: Building pipelines that keep information flowing and dashboards that answer questions before they're asked
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Creating predictive models that make systems smarter over time

## 💡 Why Work With Me?

### I'm Driven by Impact, Not Just Code
I find genuine fulfillment in creating dashboards that answer long-standing team questions and building systems that free people from soul-crushing repetitive work. When I built the **Invoice Inbox Automation** for Novus Realty, it wasn't just about the 90% time reduction—it was about giving people their time back.

### I Solve Problems, Not Just Tickets
When faced with inconsistent data formats in **FinSight Nexus**, I didn't just flag errors—I built smart validation layers that ensure data integrity while maintaining system flexibility. I think in systems, not just solutions.

### I Balance Logic with Empathy
My approach combines technical precision with genuine understanding of how people work. I don't automate for automation's sake—I build tools that make work feel more human, not less.

## 🎯 Where I'm Headed

I'm working toward becoming a **Data Automation Engineer** who specializes in bridging the gap between data analysis and workflow design. Within the next 2-3 years, I want to be the person teams call when they need systems that don't just analyze data—they act on it.

## 💼 Let's Work Together

I'm looking for opportunities where I can:
- Build data systems that solve real business problems
- Design automation workflows that give people their time back
- Create dashboards and pipelines that answer questions proactively
- Work with teams that value both technical excellence and human impact

### What I Bring to Your Team
✅ **Immediate Value**: I don't just analyze—I automate  
✅ **Systems Thinking**: I see the whole workflow, not just the data  
✅ **Business Focus**: I measure success by impact, not lines of code  
✅ **Continuous Learning**: I stay current with emerging tools and best practices
